     <p class='lead'> Hello, my name is Caterina Armenter Plaza.  I graduated from Marist College with a degree in International Business and Entrepreneurship and a minor in Information Systems in 2010. So far, I have been working as an application integration specialist for Pulsepoint for two years in the TechOps deprtment and I am loving every minute of it as I learn Linux administration and configuring servers, as well as troubleshooting the hundreds of servers Pulsepoint runs in our datacenters in Manhattan, San Jose, and Amsterdam! It’s an exciting time full of expectations, hopes and challenges. I created this website most recently in order to share with you some of my visual work in photography, my traveling experiences, my passions and concerns.
    I was born in Barcelona, but the bulk of my existence has been in New York, with spurts here and there in Los Angeles, and the Basque Country.  I speak fluent Spanish and Catalan, and a little German.  Last year I was Marist’s pioneer student in Germany’s Study Abroad Program at Reutlingen International University.  I feel very fortunate to be a part of two varied, diverse, amazing cultures that are enriched with so much history and progress. </p>

     <p class='lead'> I feel it is a privilege to be alive in these times of accelerated technological advancements.  There are so many things that I care about, and want to do with my life that sometimes I don’t know where to begin focusing.  I know that I’m good with people, that I care about society, and that I want to improve  more and more with my communication skills to one day be able to help create a business that will involve renewable energy, innovation, and conscientious progress.  I am also a visual person, I am passionate about images, lighting, design, and art.  I notice, observe and appreciate the many contrasts, contradictions, juxtapositions in external settings, and the inner workings of the human condition.  I began rather late studying computer technology, but I’m committed to continuing learning more and more.  I have created this website from scratch as I learn HTML5, and hope to continue adding other interesting aspects of my self as a young woman, entering the professional work force world.  I want to work in a company that will allow me the opportunity to combine art with business, creativity with entrepreneurship and marketing.   I am still searching for my niche, but I hear from people I admire and respect that it’s okay to acknowledge that I still don’t know my direction, and that perhaps, a door will open for me that welcomes the unknown tenacious determination to ask more questions, commit ever more fully and continue on the road with integrity and joy de vivir! </p>

     I hope you enjoy these photos as much as I enjoyed taking them. </p>
